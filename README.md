# Age-and-Gender-Prediction-Using-Deep-Learning



## Introduction to Deep Learning
Deep learning has revolutionized many fields, including computer vision, by enabling systems to understand and process images and videos with remarkable accuracy. This project uses deep learning to build a system capable of detecting human faces in images or videos and predicting their approximate age and gender.



## Deep Learning Models used
This system leverages the following pre-trained deep learning models for its functionality:

1. **Face Detection Model**: Uses OpenCV's DNN module with the `opencv_face_detector.pb` and `opencv_face_detector.pbtxt` files to locate faces in images and videos.

2. **Age Prediction Model**: A pre-trained Caffe model (`age_net.caffemodel` with `age_deploy.prototxt`) predicts the age group of the detected face from a list of age ranges (e.g., `(0-4)`, `(25-29)`, etc.).

3. **Gender Prediction Model**: Another pre-trained Caffe model (`gender_net.caffemodel` with `gender_deploy.prototxt`) predicts the gender (Male/Female) of the detected face.



## Key Features
The methodology behind this system involves the following steps:

1. **Input Processing**: Accepts input as an image file or live webcam feed.

2. **Face Detection**: Detects faces in the input using a deep learning-based face detection model.

3. **Preprocessing**: Aligns and resizes the detected face region to meet model requirements.

4. **Feature Prediction**: Processes the face through the gender and age prediction models to estimate both attributes.

5. **Output Rendering**: Displays the original image or video with bounding boxes around detected faces and labels indicating the predicted age and gender.



## Project Implementation
The system supports two modes of operation:

1. **Photo Upload Mode**: Users can upload an image, and the system will process the photo to detect faces and predict age and gender.

2. **Webcam Mode**: The system uses a live webcam feed to detect faces in real-time, providing predictions for each frame.
